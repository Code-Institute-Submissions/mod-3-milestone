## Module 3 Milestone Project - The Monkees


This is a one-page website that I created for the first Milestone Project to represent The Monkees. The website includes a landing page section, history of the band, a gallery comprising of some MP3 and MP4 clips, an events section, a contact us section with a form, and a footer with social media links and an optional newsletter signup box.

## UX


I wanted to design and create a simple website that had a 60's feel as that is when The Monkees found their fame.
I chose the colour theme to match the background image for the landing page section because I thought it was a good representation of that era. I chose that font style as I thought it was a fun and querky font that would match the tone of the website.


## Languages Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4


## Features

Because I was aiming for a simple but functional end result I tried to keep the features of the website basic and user friendly. Therefore I only used very basic HTML5 to code the media players, and a hover transition on the email submit text box in the footer.

Other than that is the 2 fixed images with some linear gradient to make the text readable.


## Testing

I have tested it on both desktop and mobile devices, and it all seems to be working well. The navigation links are all hooked up to their respective section titles, and all the media is linked up and plays quickly.

## Deployment

This site is hosted and runs directly from the master branch of its own personal repository on Github Pages. The link for which can be found [here](https://snapey1983.github.io/mod-3-milestone/).


## Credits
